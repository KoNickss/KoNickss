Hi, welcome to my page 👋

I'm a CS student at the Bucharest National College of Computer Science, I really enjoy Lnx, C, working with UNIX, making and maintaining websites, and figuring things out on my own, I really enjoy working on a team and contributing to foss. I also enjoy playing basketball, gaming, and in general talking and hangning around with people

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a NES emulator with someone, just completed the 6502 a few days ago

- 🌲 Can help you with Linux and OS management, I really enjoy working with low level langs like C rather than py or any other

- 📖 Most repos on my page so far are hello worlds on different topics, most of them really outdated and having really bad code, I'm just now starting to work on projects I'm proud of
